Contributing to SWIFTGalaxy
===========================

Contributions for SWIFTGalaxy should come as pull requests submitted to our GitHub repository, available at https://github.com/SWIFTSIM/swiftgalaxy.

Contributions are always welcome, but you should make sure of the following:

+ Your contributions pass all unit tests in `/tests` (you can check this with `pytest`).
+ Your contributions add unit tests for new functionality.
+ Your contributions are formatted with the `black` formatter (see `format.sh`).
+ Your contributions are documented fully under `/docs`.

We recognize that this can seem daunting to users new to collaborative development. Don't hesitate to get in touch for help if you want to contribute!
